I started with getting the information from the .json into the app.

I then worked on getting the image to display for the cover.

I removed the <b> and </b> from the title of each portion of the table of contents as they were out of place.

I am used to inline styling with react, so I can't make it as fancy as I would like.

I am more familiar with react and have been able to do everything I've needed without fully utilizing HTML or CSS.  So when it comes to lit-element I am not as familiar with it as well as needing to brush up on HTML and CSS.
